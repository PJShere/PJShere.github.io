Deep invited to a MF Hussain exhibit at the AICON gallery today. In typical Deep fashion he was absent. The art was fascinating. The talk given by Danny was quite enlightning in the way he was able to talk about the artist and his process. The art itself had a very existential quality about it and it had an unmistakable quality which reflected its origin, "Mother India!"<br>

For the uninitiated MF Hussain was one of India's leading modernist painter.
