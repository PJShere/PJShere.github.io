Coffee and Pork curry are not two things that have much in common but that is what Coorg is known for.
As you enter this pictorous town nestled in the mountains there is coffee everywhere.

Cardamom and Pepper is also grown in this area. We stayed on a coffee plantation and brought back a lot of coffee back with us!
