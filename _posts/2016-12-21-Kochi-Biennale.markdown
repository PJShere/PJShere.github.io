I did not know what to expect when we got into Fort Kochi for the annual biennale. Little did I know that I was going to witness the work of some of the best contemporary artists from around the globe, in a setting that matched the art. 
The colonial architecture and the mixture of the Hindu, Muslim, Catholic and Jewish cultures makes Fort Kochi a very unique place.
