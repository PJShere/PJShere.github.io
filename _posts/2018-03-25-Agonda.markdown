Located in the South of Goa, the village of Agonda is as Goan as it gets! Its an idyllic white sand beach with clear waters of the Arabian Sea gracing its shores. The place is dotted with beautiful "shacks" and cottages and a tiny main market with the usual shopping.

There is a beautiful church located right at the entrance of the village. A short scooter ride away is the fort of Cabo de Rama. The fort has an old church inside. It is quite spooky but has breathtaking views of the beautiful coastline.
