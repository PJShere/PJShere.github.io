Bangalore is a city on the move. The "Silicon Valley" of India. The roads are full of two-wheelers, cars, cows, dogs, auto-rickshaws, trash and dust. People burn garbage on the street. 
Amidst all the chaos there is a peace and calm in it. There are a lot of trees and gardens speak of a time when it was called the "garden city" of India.
