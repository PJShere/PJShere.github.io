Gokarna meaning "Cow Ear" is an idyllic beach village on the Northern Coast of Karnataka. It is a "temple town", known for its Shiva temples.
The entire area is dotted with beautiful beaches. Although not as commercialised as the ones in Goa, Gokarna can give any beach a run for its money when it comes to charm and its scenic location overlooking a hill.
