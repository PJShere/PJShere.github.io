Chennai has some beautiful architecture and Marina beach promenade is quite nice to walk.
Vivekananda House is located in an old "ice factory". The building is fascinating and the little museum in it
presents a window in the life of Swami Vivekananda the great monk of the Advaita Vedanta tradition who brought
Indian philosophy to the West.

It was also nice to have some authentic sushi at a tiny non-descript Japanese restaurant in Chennai!!
