Mumbai the city of dreams. Also happens to be my hometown! Always brings back childhood memories for me. I think it is safe to say that 90% of my family lives here! I can get out of the city but can never get it out of me.

What is not to love about this city? The maddening fast pace, the indomitable "Mumbaiyya" spirit, the local trains, Mumbai Chaat and the list goes on. Until next time solong!!
