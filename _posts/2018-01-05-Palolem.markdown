I cannot think of any other beach in Goa, which is more pictorous than Palolem. Nestled in a coconut grove forest the beach is as perfect as it gets. The Palolem Bay is perfect for swimming and has enough things going on to keep you busy for a few days!!

Patnem beach is located close by and is also an excellent beach with less people.

A side trip to Cabo de Rama, an old fort on the Arabian sea was a perfect day trip. The place has an old world charm along with an active church and cemetary which adds to its spooky aura!
